What is Combobulate?
====================

**Combobulate is under active development. Expect bugs. The development branch is usually ahead of the master branch.**

Combobulate is a package that adds structured editing and movement to a wide range of programming languages. Unlike most programming major modes that use error-prone imperative code and regular expressions to determine what's what in your code, Combobulate uses Emacs 29's tree-sitter library. Tree-sitter maintains a *concrete syntax tree* of your code; it gives Combobulate absolute clarity of all aspects of your code, enabling more correct movement and editing than you would otherwise have.

.. image:: docs/combobulate.png

Combobulate extends the existing editing and navigation capabilities of Emacs in addition to adding a range of new features you can't easily do in Emacs without Combobulate.

Combobulate's design philosophy is this:

1. It must be extensible and *relatively* easy to add new languages.

   Open ``combobulate-<lang>.el`` to see how each mode is defined.

2. Commands should broadly work the same across all languages.

3. A strong emphasis on extending and enriching the existing movement and editing commands where possible.

4. Combobulate must have a shallow learning curve.

If you want a guided tour and a deeper understanding of why Combobulate is built the way it is, then I recommend you read:

- `Combobulate: Structured Movement and Editing with Tree-Sitter <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-structured-movement-editing-treesitter>`__, for an overview of Combobulate.
- `Combobulate: Intuitive, Structured Navigation with Tree-Sitter <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-intuitive-structured-navigation-treesitter>`__, which talks about the challenges around building sensible and intuitive navigation.
- `Combobulate: Editing and Searching with the new Query Builder <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-editing-searching-new-query-builder>`__, demonstrating how Combobulate's query builder and search works.
- `Combobulate: Interactive Node Editing with Tree-Sitter <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-interactive-node-editing-treesitter>`__, where I talk about the *carousel* interface and how it makes it possible to preview complex edits to your buffer before accepting them.
- `Combobulate: Bulk Editing Tree-Sitter Nodes with Multiple Cursors <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-bulk-editing-treesitter-nodes-multiple-cursors>`__, where I explain how bulk editing with tools like Combobulate's *field editor* and *multiple cursors* work.

What does Combobulate do exactly?
---------------------------------

Combobulate is as a companion to the existing movement and editing facilities in Emacs. It's designed to sympathetically improve or supplant editing and movement in many major modes that are otherwise lacking or incorrect. If you're familiar with Emacs's many movement and editing commands, then Combobulate will feel right at home.

There's a large emphasis on Combobulate being both easy to use, and a natural extension to Emacs's already-powerful editing and movement commands.

.. image:: docs/sibling-nav-jsx.gif

For instance, navigating up or down list structures with ``C-M-u`` and ``C-M-d`` is much improved. Whether you're navigating in or out of structures in Python or JSX elements in Typescript of Javascript.

Combobulate also improves list-like navigation bound to ``C-M-n`` and ``C-M-p``, as shown above also. They now understand hierarchical code much better, and they will navigate between statements in code as well as parameters in functions or key pairs in dictionaries.

.. image:: docs/drag-complex.gif

Combobulate also adds a wide range of code editing commands, such as the ability to drag logical pieces of code up or down regardless of the size or complexity of the code. If you can navigate between elements with ``C-M-<p/n>``, then you can drag them around with ``M-P`` and ``M-N``.

.. image:: docs/expand-region.gif

Much like the popular expand regions package, Combobulate can also expand the region one syntactically interesting unit at time: first the string point is in, then the list that is in, and so on.

.. image:: docs/mc-edit-1.gif

Combobulate can also place cursors (using the optional *multiple cursors* package, or using the builtin *field editor*) at syntactically important points in your code, like: dictionary elements; function arguments; or attributes in JSX elements.

.. image:: docs/clone-dwim.gif

You can clone code with ease. If Combobulate cannot guess the exact thing you want to clone, you'll be asked to interactively preview and pick the right node to clone.

.. image:: docs/splicing.gif

Combobulate can *splice* your code. Any code. For instance, you can keep some of your HTML tags and splice them into the parent node, removing it in the process.

and much more!

Getting Started with Combobulate
--------------------------------

Combobulate has to support your programming language for it to work properly. More importantly, it should ideally be the right **Grammar version** as the table below explains. If you use a newer, or older, version you may run into issues --- not just in Combobulate, but Emacs also!

Here is a list of the languages currently supported.

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

*Don't see your language? If you want your favourite language added, then why not try it yourself? Have a look at ``combobulate-json.el`` for an example.*

When you have installed Combobulate correctly -- see below -- then it'll turn on when you open a file in one of its supported major modes. If it does not do this, try ``M-x combobulate-mode`` to activate Combobulate's minor mode.

If it's working, you'll see a ``Â©`` appear in your mode line.

At that point, Combobulate is now working. Combobulate rebinds a wide range of common navigation and editing keys. You can see a complete list by typing ``M-x describe-keymap RET combobulate-key-map``.

*Note that Combobulate may enable or disable keys depending on the major mode it is active in.*

Furthermore, Combobulate ships with a Magit-like transient UI that you can access by typing ``C-c o o``. It exists primarily to teach you about Combobulate's capabilities: every key binding in it is also available without the popup.

 [1] Either use the version built into *Emacs 30*, or you can download my ``html-ts-mode`` `here <https://github.com/mickeynp/html-ts-mode>`__, and read more about how to build your own tree-sitter major mode by reading `Let's Write a Tree-Sitter Major Mode <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/lets-write-a-treesitter-major-mode>`__.

Recent Changes / What's New
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a quick summary of recently added and changed features:

- Combobulate can now move between *sequences*, such as the start and end tags in HTML/JSX. The sequence keys are bound to ``M-n`` and ``M-p``.
- Combobulate now has its own bulk editing system called the *field editor*. Multiple cursors is also still supported. Customize ``combobulate-cursor-tool`` to change the tool you want to use.
- `The carousel interface <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-interactive-node-editing-treesitter>`__ is now used in most edit commands.
- Splicing is now more advanced than ever, and works everywhere.

  Vanish parent node is now bound to ``M-<right>`` and is know as splice outer.
- Sibling navigation is much improved. Dragging now uses the same code as sibling navigation, so node dragging will work where sibling navigation is possible.
- Combobulate now works in non-tree-sitter modes by activating tree-sitter support in the background. For instance, instead of *only* working in ``python-ts-mode``, Combobulate now also works in ``python-mode``. Most common (third party included) modes are known to Combobulate.
- Defining new languages for Combobulate to work with is much simpler.
- Most code now uses the *procedure* system, a simple DSL for specifying how to pick nodes at/around point.
- Envelope (code templating) system is greatly improved.
- More languages are supported out of the box (Go, TOML.)

Top Tips for using Combobulate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike most of Emacs's major modes and the specialized movement and editing they (may) offer, Combobulate is quite strict. It's strict about *where* you invoke certain commands or key bindings, and what happens when you type in different parts of the same line of code.

That is because of the *concrete syntax tree*. Place your point anywhere in your source code and there might be 5, 10, 15 or more "nodes" in the tree where that point intersects wildly different nodes.

For example: your point is on a string; but it's also in a list; which is in a dictionary; which is in an expression statement; which is in a ``for``-loop; which is in a function, and so on.

Because a *concrete syntax tree* is so exacting and so detailed, it's hard for Combobulate to infer what you want to do with the same casual insouciance of commands that don't use a syntax tree: there are simply too many choices and too many nodes.

You, the human, know which node you want -- but Combobulate does not necessarily know that!

So, for the best results, put your point at the *beginning* of the thing you want to interact with --- at least until you've gotten the hang of how Combobulate decides what it thinks you're asking for.

Finally, note that any command that edits your code is at best a "best guess" effort. Carefully scrutinize what Combobulate does after you invoke any command that edits your code.

Key Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Combobulate is a minor mode, and you can activate it with ``combobulate-mode``. Each grammar has its own (private!) minor mode which is chosen for you automatically. Its keys are bound in ``combobulate-LANGUAGE-map``, where LANGUAGE is a tree-sitter grammar language, such as ``go`` or ``python``. Most key bindings are the same between the language-specific minor modes. If you want to make changes that apply to all of Combobulate, then make them to ``combobulate-key-map``; conversely, use the language-specific map if you want changes made local to each language.

Customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each language has its own *Customize* group inside the Combobulate group. I would encourage you to browse the available options: ``M-x customize-group RET combobulate RET``.

How do I install Combobulate?
-----------------------------

**NOTE: The tree-sitter grammars can and do change. If that happens, it can cause issues in Emacs or Combobulate. If you see strange query validation errors or broken highlighting, try using an older grammar checkout from Git. See the table above or the example code below.**

Combobulate is not on MELPA or any other package repository, yet. For Combobulate to install properly you must meet the following requirements:

1. You must be running Emacs 29 or later.
2. Your Emacs *must* be compiled with tree-sitter support. Read `How to Get Started with Tree Sitter <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter>`__ to learn how to compile Emacs and install tree-sitter.

   In ``C-h v system-configuration-features`` look for ``TREE_SITTER``.
3. You must have language grammars installed for the languages you want to use Combobulate with.

   **However**, you can optionally ask Emacs to download, compile and install these language grammars, but you'll need a suitable C compiler. If you're using Linux, then no problem. Non-Linux users may need to install or configure their operating system to do this.

4. You're interested in using Combobulate with one of the supported languages you saw in the table above.

   (Adding support for new languages is reasonably easy though!)
5. You have a git checkout of Combobulate ready.

There's a verbose and a simple example of how to configure Combobulate in Emacs with ``use-package``. Note that if you already know how to install tree-sitter  grammars, then skip to the simple config below.

Combobulate works in non-tree-sitter-enabled major modes *as well as* the new Emacs 29 tree-sitter modes.

Complete Example with Tree-Sitter Grammar Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: if you have used Combobulate before, know that the setup for it has been simplified greatly.*

Note that this example uses ``major-mode-remap-alist`` to turn your regular major modes into the tree-sitter-enabled modes. You can always undo the changes made to this variable to return to what you had before.

Simple Combobulate Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the basic setup for Combobulate. It assumes you have installed/can install tree-sitter grammars and set it up on your own.

.. code-block:: elisp

    (use-package combobulate
       :custom
       ;; You can customize Combobulate's key prefix here.
       ;; Note that you may have to restart Emacs for this to take effect!
       (combobulate-key-prefix "C-c o")
       :hook ((prog-mode . combobulate-mode))
       ;; Amend this to the directory where you keep Combobulate's source
       ;; code.
       :load-path ("path-to-git-checkout-of-combobulate"))
