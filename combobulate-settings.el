When set to `done' the proffer UI will accept the proffered

If it is set to `cancel' then the selection is aborted as though

Use `root' and Combobulate will instead attempt to find the defun

has no defun parents.

Use `self-and-sibling-first' and Combobulate will instead first go to
the beginning of defun point is in, before cycling through
sibling defuns of the point's defun before moving up to its
parent, and so on, until it reaches the root.

it finds, regardless of hierarchy."
